Description: This package allows to estimate chronological and gestational DNA methylation
       (DNAm) age as well as biological age using different methylation clocks.
       Chronological DNAm age (in years) : Horvath's clock, Hannum's clock, BNN, 
       Horvath's skin+blood clock, PedBE clock and Wu's clock.
       Gestational DNAm age : Knight's clock, Bohlin's clock, Mayne's clock and Lee's clocks.
       Biological DNAm clocks : Levine's clock and Telomere Length's clock.
